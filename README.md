# Autonomous-RC-car
The implementation of deep neural networks on a small-scale car platform. The car module which takes images from a single frontal camera is trained by deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) in an end to end manner to produce the final outputs in a form of steering angle and throttle. Both physical and virtual parts are created to check the real performance of the project and to compare the difference between them. Robotic Operating System (ROS) on Raspberry Pi 3+ made it possible to run and test keras models with the tensorflow backend to check whether it is possible to use a single camera sensor to control and keep the car on the road (in our case on the track map).

Code is not pushed to the repo according to the privacy issues
